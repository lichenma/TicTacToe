# Building a Simple Tic Tac Toe Game with Spring Boot and AngularJS 



Starting with some knowledge regarding Spring REST APIs, we will be following a basic tutorial and 
covering some base concepts regarding web development. Ultimately, I am planning on working on building
a web application following a favourite game among my friends and I hope this project will act as a 
beginning stepping stone. Tic Tac Toe is one of the simplest games we can start with and we can cover 
many of the basics of building a turn based game.

##Introduction


We begin with an introduction to the development of this application, starting with a basic overview of
the game's functionality. The application will consist of three screens, one of which will be 
automatically generated by the Spring Security framework. 


1. The custom login page, automatically rendered by Spring Security 

2. The welcome screen where players can create a new game, join an existing game, or load a previous 
   game 

3. The game screen which displays the current game

## The Technology Stack 



The following technologies will be used to build the app (they are kind of outdated but this project
will be used as an introduction and happens to fall in line with my current company's stack) : 

* SpringBoot - Spring based project built on top of the Spring framework making it easy to start

* Spring Data JPA - Spring extension that allows creation of repositories based on Spring and JPA

* AngularJS - A JavaScript MVC framework
